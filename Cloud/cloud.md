## What is cloud technology ?

A cloud is a virtual space where users can store their software, applications including services like network, storage, databases and can share thorugh the internet without the restriciton of physical location and also cloud comes with lot of advantages like location independence, scalabilty, reliabiltiy and Better storage.

## Main features of cloud computing

- **Agility:** Huge amounts of computing resources can be provisioned within minutes.
- **Scalability:** Cloud allows to sclae up and down the resource based on demand and requirement.
- **Better storage:** There are no limitations on cloud for storage.
- **Reliability:** Data backup and disaster recovery becomes easier and less expensive.
- **Locatio independence:** Resources can be accessed anywhere from internet.

## Cloud delivery models

- **Infrastructure as a Service(IAAS):** It's also known as Hardware as service. It delivers the services like network, storage, operating system over the internet without a need of buying the physical servers and maintaining them.
  Eg: Virtual machine, Load Balancer, Virtual Network

- **Platform as a Service(PAAS):** It combines IAAS with an abstracted collection of middleware services, software development, deployment tools. PaaS helps developers quickly to create web or mobile apps.
  Eg: Function apps, web apps

- **Software as a Service(SAAS):** It is software on-demand. It is a software in which the applications are hosted by a cloud service provider.

## Different versions of cloud

- **Public Cloud:** The set of services like network, storage, hardware e.t.c are maintained and operated by third party like azure. They build highly scalable physical data centers that hides the underlying infrastructure from the consumer. They're successfull because they offer many options for computing, storage, and a rich set of other services.

- **Private Cloud:** The set of service network, storage, hardware e.t.c are owned and maintained by a organization fo9r it's employees, customers. They're not publicly available, these are highly secured as they sit behind the firewall.

- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public and private cloud.

- **Multi Cloud:** Some companies use variety of public clouds to suuprt their business.
