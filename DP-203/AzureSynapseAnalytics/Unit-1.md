**SQL Database:**

- Designed for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) workloads. Ideal for applications that require frequent reads and writes with low latency.
- Relational database for storing structured transactional data.
- Easily integrates with Azure App Services, Azure Functions, and other application services.

**SQL Data Warehouse (Synapse Analytics):**

- Designed for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workloads. Optimized for large-scale data analytics and reporting.
- Integrates with Azure Data Factory, Power BI, and big data tools like Spark and Databricks for advanced analytics.
- Relational model optimized for analytical workloads. Uses a columnar storage format for faster aggregation queries.

**Creation of External Table:**<br>
In Azure Synapse Analytics, an external table is a type of table that provides a schema on top of external data stored outside the Synapse database (e.g., in Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or other external sources). Unlike regular tables, external tables do not store the data within Synapse. Instead, they reference data stored externally and allow you to query it using T-SQL without ingesting it into the Synapse database.
