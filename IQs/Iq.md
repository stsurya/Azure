# ✅ **DevOps & Cloud Security Interview Notes – By Surya Teja Chatrathi**

### 1. ❓ What is **Immutable Infrastructure**?

> Immutable infrastructure is a model where servers or components are **never modified after deployment**. Any change requires replacing the whole resource (e.g., create new VM/image).
>
> This ensures **consistency, repeatability, and reduced configuration drift**.

🟢 **Example**: Instead of patching a live VM, you build a new VM image using Packer and deploy it via Terraform.

---

### 2. 🔁 **Mutable vs Immutable Infrastructure (with Benefit)**

| Type          | Description                                | Example                       | Benefit                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Mutable**   | You can SSH into the VM and make changes.  | Manually installing packages. | Quick changes but prone to drift/errors.      |
| **Immutable** | VMs or containers are recreated on change. | Replacing VM with new image   | Stable, version-controlled, consistent infra. |

🎯 **Benefit of Immutable**: Predictable deployments and easier rollback.

### 3. 🔄 **RTO vs RPO** in Disaster Recovery

| Term    | Full Form                | Meaning                                            |
| ------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **RTO** | Recovery Time Objective  | How fast you can recover after a failure.          |
| **RPO** | Recovery Point Objective | How much **data loss** (in time) you can tolerate. |

🧠 **Example**:
If RPO = 15 mins, max data loss = 15 mins.
If RTO = 2 hrs, system must be back within 2 hrs.

---

### 4. 💥 What is **Chaos Engineering**?

> Chaos Engineering is the practice of **intentionally injecting faults or failures** into systems to test their **resilience and recovery behavior**.

🧪 **Example**: Using tools like Chaos Monkey to randomly kill VMs in production to ensure auto-scaling works.

---

### 5. 👨‍💻 Who is a **Chaos Engineer**?

> A Chaos Engineer designs and executes experiments that simulate **real-world failures** to validate the reliability and robustness of systems.

---

### 6. 🔄 What is **GitOps**?

> GitOps is a DevOps practice where **Git is the source of truth** for both **application and infrastructure configurations**. Changes are made via **pull requests**, then automatically applied by CI/CD tools.

🛠️ **Tools**: ArgoCD, Flux

📌 **Example**: Change a Kubernetes deployment YAML in Git → Flux/ArgoCD detects and applies it automatically.

---

### 7. 🕵️ **Threat vs Vulnerability**

| Term              | Meaning                        | Example                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Threat**        | Potential danger               | Hacker, malware             |
| **Vulnerability** | Weakness that can be exploited | Unpatched server, open port |

📌 **Example**:

- Threat = Attacker
- Vulnerability = Open RDP port
- Risk = Brute force login attempt via RDP

---

### 8. 🔐 What is **Zero Trust Security**?

> Zero Trust is a security model that says **“never trust, always verify”**—whether the user or device is inside or outside the network.

🎯 **Principles**:

- Verify explicitly (MFA, device posture, location)
- Least privilege access
- Assume breach

🧰 **Azure Example**:

- Use Azure AD + Conditional Access
- Managed Identity for resource access
- Private Endpoints for secure networking

---

### 9. 🔐 Zero Trust in Azure and CI/CD

🟦 **Azure Example**:

- Function App uses Managed Identity to access Key Vault
- Private Endpoints used for Key Vault & SQL
- Conditional Access to restrict admin access

🧪 **CI/CD Example**:

- Use Service Connections with RBAC
- Secrets stored in Azure Key Vault
- Validate deployments with security scans

---

### 10. 🌐 What is **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)?**

> A DDoS attack floods a service or network with **massive traffic** from many sources (botnet) to make it **unavailable**.

🎯 **Protection Strategies**:

- Azure DDoS Protection
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Rate limiting & traffic filtering
- CDN for traffic absorption

---

### 11. How to prevent DDoS Attack ?

To prevent DDoS attacks, I use Azure DDoS Protection for automatic mitigation, Application Gateway with WAF for Layer 7 filtering, and implement rate limiting at API level. I also use private endpoints to restrict exposure, monitor traffic using Sentinel, and ensure the system is resilient with auto-scaling and CDN support.
