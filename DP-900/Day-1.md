# Data Formats

You can classify data as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

## structured data

- Structured Data is data that adheres to fixed schema, so all the data has the same field or properties. Generally this will be in tabular format.
- Structured data is often stored in a database in which multiple tables can reference one another by using key values in a relational model.

## semi-structured data

- Semi-structured data is information that has some structure, but which allows for some variation between entity instances.
  Eg: JSON, XML.

## un-structured data

- Not all the data is structured or semi-structured. Audio,Video, Binary files all these comed under un-strucutred data.
