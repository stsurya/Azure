## Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor is Microsoft Azure’s central platform for monitoring the performance and health of your applications, infrastructure, and services — both on-premises and in the cloud.

It's not a single service — it's a suite of tools that collect, analyze, and act on telemetry (logs and metrics) from various Azure resources.
