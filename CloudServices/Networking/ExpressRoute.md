### Express Route

Azure **ExpressRoute** is a service that enables private, dedicated, and high-speed connections between on-premises networks and Microsoft cloud services, such as **Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365**. It bypasses the public internet, providing **higher security, reliability, and lower latency** compared to traditional VPN connections.

### **Key Features of ExpressRoute:**

1. **Private Connectivity** ‚Äì Traffic does not travel over the public internet, enhancing security.
2. **High Performance & Low Latency** ‚Äì Offers predictable, high-speed connections (50 Mbps to 100 Gbps).
3. **Reliability** ‚Äì Provides an SLA-backed uptime of **99.95%** or higher.
4. **Redundant Connections** ‚Äì Uses dual connections for failover.
5. **Connectivity to Microsoft Services** ‚Äì Supports Azure services, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365.

### **ExpressRoute vs VPN:**

| Feature      | ExpressRoute   | VPN (Site-to-Site)              |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Connectivity | Private        | Public Internet                 |
| Speed        | Up to 100 Gbps | Limited to 10 Gbps              |
| Latency      | Low            | Higher due to internet routing  |
| Security     | More Secure    | Encrypted but over the internet |
| SLA          | 99.95%+        | No SLA for VPN                  |

### **Use Cases:**

- **Enterprise Hybrid Cloud** ‚Äì Securely connect data centers to Azure.
- **Disaster Recovery** ‚Äì Fast and reliable replication to Azure.
- **Data Migration** ‚Äì Transfer large amounts of data securely.
- **Financial & Healthcare Industries** ‚Äì Organizations that require strict compliance and low latency.

### ExpressRoute connectivity models

Azure **ExpressRoute** offers different ways to connect your on-premises network to the Microsoft cloud. Think of it like different types of private highways connecting your data center to Azure without using the public internet. Here are the four main connectivity models:

### **1. Cloud Exchange Colocation** üè¢

- If your company already has servers in a data center that has a Microsoft connection, you can **rent a private link** from the data center provider to connect to Azure.
- The connection can be **Layer 2** (raw network link) or **Layer 3** (managed by the provider).

**Analogy:** Like renting a private tunnel from your office to a Microsoft building inside the same business park.

### **2. Point-to-Point Ethernet Connection** üîó

- A dedicated **fiber cable** from your office or data center **directly to Azure**.
- Can be **Layer 2** (you control everything) or **Layer 3** (managed by the provider).

**Analogy:** Like having a **direct private road** from your office to Microsoft‚Äôs data center.

### **3. Any-to-Any (IPVPN) Connection** üåé

- If you already have a **wide-area network (WAN)** connecting multiple offices, you can **extend it to include Azure**.
- Your cloud connection works like another branch office.
- Uses **Layer 3**, so it‚Äôs managed by the provider.

**Analogy:** Like adding **Microsoft as a new branch** in your company‚Äôs private network.

### **4. ExpressRoute Direct** üöÄ

- If you need **super-fast speeds** (10 Gbps or 100 Gbps), you can **connect directly** to Microsoft at an ExpressRoute location.
- Supports **active/active** redundancy for high availability.

**Analogy:** Like getting an **exclusive VIP highway** straight to Microsoft with no traffic limits.

### **Peering in ExpressRoute**

Peering in **ExpressRoute** is required to define **how traffic flows** between your on-premises network and Microsoft‚Äôs cloud services. Without peering, your ExpressRoute circuit is just a connection with **no defined routes** for communication.

### **Purpose of Each Peering Type:**

1. **Azure Private Peering** üè¢üîó‚òÅÔ∏è

   - Enables **private** connectivity between your **on-premises** network and Azure Virtual Networks (VNets).
   - Used for **VMs, Azure SQL, Storage accounts (with private endpoints), etc.**
   - Bypasses the internet, ensuring **low latency and high security**.

2. **Microsoft Peering** üè¢üîóüìß
   - Provides **direct access to Microsoft services like Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure PaaS (e.g., Azure Storage, Azure App Service, etc.)**
   - Uses **public IPs**, but the connection remains private (does not traverse the internet).
   - Improves **performance** for Microsoft SaaS applications by avoiding congestion on public networks.

### **Why Not Use Just One Peering?**

Each peering type serves a **different use case**.

- If you only need **private connections to Azure VNets**, use **Azure Private Peering**.
- If you need access to **Microsoft SaaS/PaaS services**, enable **Microsoft Peering**.
- **Both can be configured on the same ExpressRoute circuit** if needed.

### **Key Benefit of Peering**

‚úÖ **Better security** (No public internet exposure)  
‚úÖ **Lower latency & higher reliability**  
‚úÖ **Faster access to Microsoft services**
