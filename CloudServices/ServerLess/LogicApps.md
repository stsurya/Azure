## Logic Apps

- Azure logic apps is a cloud service where you can create and run automated workflows with little to no code.
- By using Visual desginer and 1000+ pre-built operations we can design the workflow that integrates and manages the apps,data.
- A workflow is a series of steps to perform a task or business process. Each workflow will be having a trigger point, which is starting point of workflow. After the initial trigger, the remaining set of operations will be exectued one-by-one.
- The initial trigger can be anything something like an emain in inbox, or detecting a file in storage account.

## What is the difference b/w Consumption plan and Standard plan in Logic Apps ?

**Consumption Plan:**

Cost: Pay-per-use model, cost-effective for low-frequency or unpredictable workloads. You only pay for the actions executed in your logic apps.
Scalability: Automatic scaling, but may experience cold starts.
Use Cases: Event-driven scenarios, prototyping, development, and non-critical production workloads.

**Standard Plan:**

Cost: Fixed pricing based on provisioned resources, potentially more cost-effective for high-frequency workloads.
Scalability: Manual and auto-scaling with dedicated resources, no cold starts.
Use Cases: High-frequency, mission-critical workloads, enterprise-grade applications, and scenarios requiring predictable performance and advanced features.
