## Logic Apps

- Azure logic apps is a cloud service where you can create and run automated workflows with little to no code.
- By using Visual desginer and 1000+ pre-built operations we can design the workflow that integrates and manages the apps,data.
- A workflow is a series of steps to perform a task or business process. Each workflow will be having a trigger point, which is starting point of workflow. After the initial trigger, the remaining set of operations will be exectued one-by-one.
- The initial trigger can be anything something like an emain in inbox, or detecting a file in storage account.
