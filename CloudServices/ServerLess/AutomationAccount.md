## Azure Automation Account

Azure automation account is the compute service which is suitable in scripting scenarios to automate repeated tasks.
An Azure Automation Account can have multiple "RUNBOOKS" - which is the component that executes a piece of code.
Azure automation accounts were mainly used for solving repeated admin operations (onboarding a user, offboarding a user, adding tags to resources, etc.). You can have PowerShell modules or Python packages imported in your runbook to perform slightly complicated tasks that Logic Apps would struggle with.
