## Azure SQL Database

Azure SQL Database is fully managed, cloud-based relational database service offered by Azure. It allows us to create, scale and manage databases without managing the underlying infrastructure.

### Purchasing Models

There are two purchasing models in SQL

**i) vCore-based purchasing model:**

- Choose the exact resources you need (like CPU, memory, and storage).
- Pay only for what you use.

**ii) DTU-based purchasing model:**

- Get a bundle of resources (compute, memory, and I/O) in three tiers (Basic, Standard, Premium).
- Each tier has different levels of resources (like CPU, memory, and storage).
- Can add more storage if needed.
