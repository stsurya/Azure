- It is used to store unstructured data.
- This is ideal when you have storage solutions for files, videos, log files, and images
  It has different tier levels:
- Hot storage tier: It is ideal for objects that are accessed frequently
- Cool storage tier: It is optimized for data that are infrequently accessed. This is a less expensive option than the hot storage tier
- Achieve storage tier: It is optimized for data that is rarely accessed. Mostly used for archiving or backup data. It is the least expensive service. If you want to access data in archive tier first you need to move data into cold tier or hot tier.
