## Virtual Machine Scale Sets

Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide the following key benefits:

- Easy to create and manage multiple VMs
- Provides high availability and application resiliency by distributing VMs across availability zones or fault domains
- Allows your application to automatically scale as resource demand changes
- Works at large-scale

- Virtual Machine scale sets are currently available on all Azure Windows or Linux VM sizes. You are only charged for the Azure VMs you deploy, as well as any additional underlying infrastructure resources consumed such as storage and networking. There are no incremental charges for the Virtual Machine scale sets service itself.
