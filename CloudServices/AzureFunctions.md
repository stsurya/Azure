## Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allowas you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaing the servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.

## Azure Functions support availiability Zones

- Availiability zones is only supported on Premium Plan.
- You cannot convert the existing function app to availiability zones.
- You must use ZRS fro your function app storage account otherwise it may show unexpected behavior during a zonal outage.
- Availability zone support isn't currently available for function apps on Consumption plans.

## What is a Cold Start in Azure Function Apps?

A cold start in function app occurs when latency is experienced when a function app is invoked after being idle for sometime. This latency is due to the time it takes to initialize the function's runtime environment and load the necessary application code and dependencies before the function can handle the incoming request.

## Why Does a Cold Start Occur?

**Serverless Architecture:**

- In serverless architectures, resources are dynamically allocated. When a function is invoked, Azure must allocate resources (compute power) and initialize the runtime environment.
- This resource allocation and initialization process leads to a delay, known as a cold start.

**Idle Periods:**

- If a function has not been invoked for a period of time, Azure may deallocate the resources to optimize costs and resource usage.
- When the function is triggered again after being idle, Azure needs to reallocate resources and reinitialize the environment, causing a cold start.

**Consumption Plan:**

- The Consumption plan is designed to be cost-effective by scaling out and in dynamically based on the number of incoming requests.
- This dynamic scaling includes shutting down idle instances, which then require a cold start when invoked again.

**First Invocation:**

- The first time a function is invoked after deployment or redeployment, it will experience a cold start because Azure has to set up the execution environment.

## Mitigating Cold Starts in Azure Function Apps

- **Premium Plan:** Provides pre-warmed instances, meaning your function apps are kept warm and ready to handle requests without delay.
- **Dedicated (App Service) Plan:** Offers dedicated resources that are always running, thereby avoiding cold starts.
- **Timer Triggers:** Schedule a timer trigger to periodically invoke a function (e.g., every 5 minutes) to keep the instance warm.
- **Durable Functions:** Use Durable Functions to maintain a stateful workflow, which can help keep the function app active and reduce cold start occurrences.
- **Always On:** Ensure the "Always On" setting is enabled in the app settings. This is particularly effective in the App Service Plan, as it keeps the app running and avoids cold starts.
- **Minimize Dependencies:** Reduce the number of dependencies and optimize the initialization code to speed up the startup process.
- **Efficient Coding Practices:** Ensure your functions are written efficiently to minimize the time taken during initialization.

## What is the difference between Dedicated and Premium plan in azure functions ?

The Dedicated plan provides more flexibility in terms of infrastructure choices, while the Premium plan offers better compute instances and Virtual Network integration.
