## Logic App Vs Function App

- Functions and logic apps are azure services that enables serverless workloads.
- Function apps are serverless compute service, whereas logic apps are serverless workflow integration platform.
- Both can be used to perform orchestrations. Orchestration means a bunch of functions in function apps or actions in azure logic apps to complete a task.
- We need to write code to build Functions, we can use GUI to build workgflows in logic apps.
- You can mix and match services when you build an orchestration, such as calling functions from logic app workflows and calling logic app workflows from functions.
