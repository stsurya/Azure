- CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It is an IP address assigning method that improves the efficiency of ip address distribution.
- By using CIDR IP address many unique IP addresses can be designated. CIDR IP address is same as normal IP address except that it ends with slash followed by a number.

  172.200.0.0/16 --> four block --> each - block 8bits...The block size must be of power 2 and equal to the total number of IP addresses.
